# Kdrama-Analysis
Practicing R by analysing a kdrama dataset

Hi! This is a personal project where I practiced using R for data data wrangling, visualization, and basic analysis. The dataset I used is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saikalbatyrbekova/korean-dramas-dataset-eda/data , it contains information of 350 Korean Dramas from year 2003 to 2025, including titles, release years, genres, ratings, actors.

âœ¨ What I did
1. Summary Statistics
  - Count of dramas, unique genres, tags
  - Average number of episodes and ratings


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Average K-Drama Ratings by Year
  - Number of K-Dramas Released Per Year


3. Sentiment Analysis
  - Analyzed drama descriptions using the Bing sentiment lexicon
  - Identified dramas with the highest and lowest sentiment scores
    

4. Genre-Based Analysis
  - Calculated average ratings for each genre
  - Visualized the top 10 genres with ratings above 8.0
    

5. Actor Performance Analysis
  - Identified actors who consistently appear in dramas rated 7.0 and above
  - Filtered actors with at least 5 drama appearances
  - Ranked them by average rating
